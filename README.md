# house-price-prediction

House price prediction is a common and valuable machine learning project that falls under the domain of regression analysis. In this project, you aim to predict the selling price of houses based on various features or attributes of the houses. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you get started on a house price prediction project:

Data Collection:

Gather a dataset that contains information about houses. You can find such datasets on websites like Kaggle, government housing agencies, or from real estate websites.
Data Preprocessing:

Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
Handle missing data: Decide how to impute or remove missing values.
Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Scale and normalize numerical features if needed.
Feature Selection/Engineering:

Select relevant features that are likely to influence house prices.
Create new features or transform existing ones if they can provide more information for the model.
Split the Data:

Divide the dataset into a training set and a testing set. A common split is 70-80% for training and 20-30% for testing.
Choose a Machine Learning Algorithm:

Regression algorithms are suitable for this task. Common choices include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Training:

Train your chosen machine learning model on the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Use evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the model's performance on the test data.
Consider using cross-validation to get a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tune your model by adjusting hyperparameters to improve its performance. You can use techniques like grid search or random search.
Model Deployment:

If you plan to deploy the model for practical use, you need to set up an environment for it and integrate it with an application or website.
Interpret the Model:

Understand which features have the most significant impact on house prices. This can provide valuable insights.
